China claims that an internal decision by Germany is ""interfering in China's internal affairs"" and threatens ""retaliation"" unless Germany allows a ""private"" company to compromise communication security within Germany's borders.  They also claim that a bill passed by the US congress is interfering in china's internal affairs.  Yet they find it OK to violate the treaty they signed guaranteeing a ""one country, two systems"" when Great Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese control by violently suppressing free speech in the former colony, even though they could have avoided the embarrassment by just not attempting to put Hong Cong under the mainland system, as promised.  China may be among the worlds superpowers, but they need to be taught that this does not make them gods to be obeyed or else",Aaron68499,0,2019-12-15 23:37:05,1576445825.0
