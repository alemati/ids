I gave a drinking water bottle to my wife to use in the toilet for cleaning. Health Safety & Hygienic condition is the first priority in our daily life followed by Environmental protection in the present day world.   The primary object of cleanliness is to maintain the health & prevent the disease. Water is the best cleaning agent in the world. It is simple, easy, cheap and safest method of cleaning. Our day starts with cleaning ourselves with water & also ends with water before going to bed. Water is an Universal cleaning agent to maintain hygienic conditions in our daily life throughout the world except few rare exemptions. Toilet in Airports without the water outlet is total negligence of hygienic condition. It is the minimum right of Air passenger to use water for cleaning themselves in the toilet. Toilet paper cannot be substitute of water. It is difficult to scrub the sticky waste with paper without being spread on buttocks & anus and as well as on hand. The paper with traces of feces is thrown in a waste collector & decays with a bad smell till it is cleared.  Environment is synonymous to greenery or trees/plants. It is impossible to stop the cutting of trees and plants but we can control it by material restrictions made from wood, like paperless communication. We also try to balance the ecological system by planting trees. Please note that the trees play an important role in maintaining the balance of chemistry of elements on this good earth particularly lifesaving elements. Toilet paper is made from the hard wood, soft wood, water, chemicals and bleaches. Chlorine used for bleaching produces dioxins which are highly toxic pollutants. It is required to cut 27000 trees each day to meet the daily requirement of toilet paper.   It is established & understood well that the toilet paper production and its use is causing severe damage to the environment and restriction of water outlets in toilets is gross negligence of health & hygienic condition. I would like to bring to the notice of The International Civil Aviation Authority, General Authority of Civil Aviation & other local Airport Authorities to immediately issue a mandatory notice to provide hand held water pipe outlets/ bidet spray in toilets for spraying and cleaning private parts with water manually.",rightman44,1,2019-09-19 10:06:42,1568876802.0
